### Building Machine Learning Models using [PYCARET](https://pycaret.org/) Package

PyCaret, an open source machine learning library in Python to train and deploy supervised and unsupervised machine learning models in a low-code environment.

`pip install pycaret`

PyCaret is essentially a Python wrapper around several machine learning libraries and frameworks such as scikit-learn, XGBoost, Microsoft LightGBM, spaCy, and many more.

PyCaret is simple and easy to use. All the operations performed in PyCaret are sequentially stored in a Pipeline that is fully orchestrated for deployment. Whether its imputing missing values, transforming categorical data, feature engineering or even hyperparameter tuning, PyCaret automates all of it.

Pycaret can be used for various preprocessing steps and ML applications:
* ___Clustering__ — Group data points with similar characteristics._
* ___Anomaly Detection__ — Identify rare observations / outliers in the data._
* ___Natural Language Processing__ — Analyze text data via topic modeling._
* ___Association Rule Mining__ — Find interesting relationships in the data._
* ___Classification__ — Predict categorical class labels that are binary (1 or 0)._
* ___Regression__ — Predict continuous value such as Sales, Price etc._
