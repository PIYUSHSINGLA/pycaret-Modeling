### Building Machine Learning Models using [PYCARET](https://pycaret.org/) Package

PyCaret, an open source machine learning library in Python to train and deploy supervised and unsupervised machine learning models in a low-code environment.

`pip install pycaret`

PyCaret is essentially a Python wrapper around several machine learning libraries and frameworks such as scikit-learn, XGBoost, Microsoft LightGBM, spaCy, and many more.

PyCaret is simple and easy to use. All the operations performed in PyCaret are sequentially stored in a Pipeline that is fully orchestrated for deployment. Whether its imputing missing values, transforming categorical data, feature engineering or even hyperparameter tuning, PyCaret automates all of it.
